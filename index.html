      <p>
        Manifestation is the practice of thinking aspirational thoughts with the
        purpose of making them reality. If you keenly study your life, you'll
        understand that everything which you have now in your life is the end
        product of what your past thoughts and actions were. Think about the
        areas of your life where you feel such unshakable confidence, even if
        it‚Äôs something small like a hobby or skill. That area of your life just
        flows, right? That‚Äôs because you have high subconscious self-worth in
        that area, and self-worth is the law of attraction.
        <br />
        <br />
        You‚Äôre already manifesting and you didn‚Äôt even realize it. Now, think of
        an area where you just never can seem to get what you
        want‚Äîrelationships, money, career, friends, whatever That area of life
        that always feels sticky. Is there anyone around you who models exactly
        what you want in that area? Or did you witness or experience pain,
        shame, or limiting beliefs around that area of life as a kid? You‚Äôre not
        getting what you want in this part of your life (aka manifesting)
        because of low subconscious self-worth, and your brain‚Äôs inability to
        ‚Äòsee-to-believe‚Äô that what you want is possible for you,‚Äù
